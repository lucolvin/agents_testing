# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

This repository is ready for GitHub Pages deployment. Follow these steps to enable GitHub Pages using the main branch as the source.

## Prerequisites

- âœ… Repository contains a valid `index.html` file
- âœ… HTML file is well-structured with CSS and JavaScript
- âœ… Page is mobile-responsive and interactive
- âœ… All functionality has been tested and verified

## Steps to Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/lucolvin/codex_testing`
   - Click on the "Settings" tab

2. **Access Pages Configuration**
   - In the left sidebar, scroll down and click on "Pages"

3. **Configure Source Settings**
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" from the branch dropdown
   - Select "/ (root)" as the folder (since `index.html` is in the root directory)
   - Click "Save"

4. **Wait for Deployment**
   - GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site
   - This process typically takes 1-5 minutes
   - You'll see a green checkmark when deployment is complete

## Expected Results

After enabling GitHub Pages, your site will be available at:
```
https://lucolvin.github.io/codex_testing/
```

## Page Features

The deployed page includes:

- **ðŸš€ Modern Design**: Clean, responsive layout with gradient background
- **ðŸŽ¨ Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **âš¡ Interactive Elements**: 
  - Clickable feature cards with highlight animations
  - Interactive counter with increment/decrement/reset functionality
  - Keyboard shortcuts (â†‘/+, â†“/-, 0/r for reset)
- **ðŸ“± Mobile Ready**: Optimized for all screen sizes

## Testing the Deployment

Once GitHub Pages is enabled, you can test the deployment by:

1. Visiting the GitHub Pages URL
2. Testing the interactive counter functionality
3. Verifying responsive design on different screen sizes
4. Checking that all animations and JavaScript features work correctly

## Troubleshooting

If the page doesn't load correctly:

1. **Check Branch**: Ensure you selected the "main" branch, not "copilot/fix-5"
2. **Verify File Location**: Confirm `index.html` is in the root directory
3. **Wait for Build**: Allow 5-10 minutes for the initial deployment
4. **Clear Cache**: Try refreshing the page or clearing your browser cache
